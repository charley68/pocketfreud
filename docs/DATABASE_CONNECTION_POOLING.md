# Database Connection Pooling Implementation

## Overview

The `db.py` module has been refactored to use connection pooling with `dbutils.pooled_db.PooledDB` for improved performance and connection management. This change maintains full compatibility with existing code while providing significant performance benefits through connection reuse.

## Changes Made

### 1. Connection Pooling Setup

- **Added**: Connection pool initialization using `dbutils.pooled_db.PooledDB`
- **Added**: Global connection pool instance managed at module level
- **Updated**: `get_db_connection()` now returns pooled connections instead of creating new ones

### 2. Connection Pool Configuration

```python
_connection_pool = PooledDB(
    creator=pymysql,          # Database module
    maxconnections=20,        # Maximum total connections
    mincached=2,             # Minimum idle connections in pool
    maxcached=5,             # Maximum idle connections in pool
    maxshared=3,             # Maximum shared connections
    blocking=True,           # Block if no connections available
    ping=1,                  # Ping MySQL to check connection health
    charset='utf8mb4',       # Proper UTF-8 encoding
    autocommit=False         # Explicit transaction control
)
```

### 3. Bug Fixes

Fixed several functions that were not properly closing database connections:
- `get_last_summary()`
- `get_last_summary_checkpoint()`
- `get_messages_after()`
- `save_summary()`
- `get_journals_by_days()`

All functions now use proper try/finally blocks to ensure connections are returned to the pool.

### 4. New Utility Functions

- `shutdown_connection_pool()`: Properly shuts down the connection pool
- `get_pool_info()`: Returns information about the pool status (for monitoring)

## Performance Benefits

1. **Connection Reuse**: Eliminates the overhead of creating/destroying connections
2. **Connection Sharing**: Multiple requests can share connections when appropriate
3. **Health Monitoring**: Automatic ping checks ensure connection validity
4. **Resource Management**: Controlled number of active connections
5. **Thread Safety**: Built-in thread safety for concurrent access

## Backward Compatibility

âœ… **Full backward compatibility maintained**

- All existing functions work unchanged
- Same API surface - no breaking changes
- Connection objects behave identically to pymysql connections
- Both `with conn:` and `conn.close()` patterns work correctly

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Same as Before)

```python
from modules.db import get_db_connection

# Standard usage - no changes needed
def get_user(user_id):
    conn = get_db_connection()
    try:
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))
        return cursor.fetchone()
    finally:
        conn.close()  # Returns connection to pool
```

### Context Manager Pattern

```python
def create_user(username, email):
    conn = get_db_connection()
    with conn:  # Automatically handles commit/rollback and connection return
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute(
            "INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES (%s, %s)",
            (username, email)
        )
        return cursor.lastrowid
```

### Application Shutdown

```python
from modules.db import shutdown_connection_pool

# Call during application shutdown for clean resource cleanup
def app_shutdown():
    shutdown_connection_pool()
```

## Monitoring

```python
from modules.db import get_pool_info

# Monitor pool status
pool_info = get_pool_info()
print(pool_info)
# Output: {'status': 'initialized', 'pool_type': 'dbutils.pooled_db.PooledDB'}
```

## Configuration Tuning

The connection pool can be tuned by modifying the parameters in `_init_connection_pool()`:

- **`maxconnections`**: Increase for high-traffic applications (default: 20)
- **`mincached`**: Minimum always-ready connections (default: 2)
- **`maxcached`**: Maximum idle connections to keep (default: 5)
- **`maxshared`**: Maximum connections that can be shared (default: 3)

## Error Handling

The pooled connections handle errors gracefully:
- Failed connections are automatically replaced
- Network disconnections are detected via ping
- Connection timeouts are handled transparently
- All pymysql exceptions are preserved

## Thread Safety

The connection pool is fully thread-safe and can handle concurrent requests from multiple threads without any additional synchronization required.

## Testing

All existing tests pass without modification. The pooling implementation is transparent to application code and maintains full compatibility with the existing database layer.

## Dependencies

- `dbutils`: Connection pooling library (already in requirements.txt)
- `pymysql`: MySQL database connector (existing dependency)

## Migration Notes

No migration steps required - the changes are transparent to existing code. The application will automatically benefit from connection pooling upon restart.
