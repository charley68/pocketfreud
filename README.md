Background & Motivation


In 2023, I experienced a period of depression and anxiety following an unexpected redundancy from my job. During this time, I sought support through private counselling services but found them prohibitively expensive and not always accessible. As an alternative, I began using ChatGPT as a form of emotional support and found it powerful, but lacking in features that could provide a more consistent and structured form of care.


Origin of the Idea

In December 2024, I began exploring artificial intelligence more deeply, with the goal of building a project that could improve mental wellness accessibility. This led to the conceptualization of PocketFreud—a conversational AI-powered emotional support companion designed to offer affordable, on-demand, and personalized support for emotional well-being.


Key Milestones

March 31, 2025: I created a private GitHub repository titled pocketfreud under my personal GitHub account charley68 to begin development of the application.
April 13, 2025: I registered the domain name pocketfreud.com via Hostinger, intending to deploy the service as a web-based application.


Independence from Future Employment

This project was initiated independently, on my own time, using personal resources. It is not related to any current or future employer’s business or technology. All work on PocketFreud has been done outside of any formal employment contracts and prior to any job offers or employment with companies such as JPMorgan or others.


Intent

PocketFreud is a personal innovation project driven by my lived experience and technical curiosity. The project is currently in development and not yet monetized, but I reserve all rights to its intellectual property, codebase, branding, and future commercial applications.
